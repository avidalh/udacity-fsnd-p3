# udacity-fsnd-p3
Udacity FullStack NanoDegree Project 3. Item Catalog.

## Synopsis

<!-- At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)
 -->
This is my FullStack NanoDegree's third project, aka **Item Catalog**.
It's a web application based on Flask, SQLAlchemy and (of course) Python.

<!-- ## Code Example -->

<!-- Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
 -->


## Motivation

This is my FullStack NanoDegree's third project, aka **Item Catalog**.
<!-- 
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.
 -->

##Requirements

All requirements are especified in the autogenerated file **`requirements.txt`**
The easy way to be sure your system are ready to execute the application is by doing the following:
 ** `pip install -r requirements.txt` **


## Installation

To install the application follow the nex steps:
- Option 1: **Clone the repository.** If you are a **git** user do this: 
	From the sytem's command line execute `git clone https://github.com/avidalh/udacity-fsnd-p3`, this action will create the directory `udacity-fsnd-p3` where the project has been downloaded.

- Option 2: **Download the zip file.** If you are not a **git** user:
	Download the zip file `https://github.com/avidalh/udacity-fsnd-p3/archive/master.zip` from GitHub and descompress it on your system at the best place you decide.

<!-- Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project. -->

## Running the app

The application can be executed on almost every system with python 2.7. (e.g. MacOS-X, Linux, Unixes, etc.) I've tested the correct the app in MacOS-X and Ubuntu, this last one running in a Vagrant virtual machine.
To execute the app you have some options:
- To run the application just type **`python application`** on your system's command line.
- Open the `application.py` with IDLE and select run.


<!-- Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
